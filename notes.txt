    start load_AHRI_directories.R to read AHRI directories into R
    
    did I accidentally down load the same records twice?
    no only downloads the first 250 records.
    
    redo search w/ Max GPM <= 5.0 , then Max GPM >= 5.1
    
    download the Energy Guide Label pdf files

    loading CEC directory, a lot of strange data 
    and UEF came through as logical even though specified col_type as double
    had to use guess_max as 15000 and not set col_type
    
    I was mistaken, should have used a "l" instead of a "|".
    
    plot of UEF vs RE looks reasonable
    
    loaded DOE directory UEF vs RE looks similar to the CEC one
    
    clean up CEC tankless directory names
    
    And here's what on the Energy Guide Label
        Max GPM
        GPM Rating {very small | low | medium | high}
        Estimated yearly energy use (in therms)
            Not clear whether this is total energy use or just the gas use.
        cost ( This is therms * $1.09/therm)

    translating energyguide.pl into .R to parse the Energy Guide labels with
    pdfimages, convert, tesseract 
    
    
    check AHRI data to see if Estimated yearly energy use from Energy Guide Label
    is equal to Uniform Energy Factor / Qout from test draw pattern
    that might show the difference of Annual Energy total vs fossil

    got convert and tesseract to work
    better to convert them all to text files then use a different script to extract data.
        
    see http://www.mjdenny.com/Text_Processing_In_R.html
    and https://quanteda.io/articles/quickstart.html, this one is probably too elaborate
    
    These AHRIrefnums don't have Energy Guide Labels posted on the AHRI directory.

    since the *.txt files are small, read them in as one long string into the data.table
    removed \n \r & \f first.

    need to parse out the brand, MaxGPM, model_num, and Eannual,f (if that's what it is)
    the files aren't completely consistent, so this may be messy.
    quicker and less messy inside data.table
    
    parsed into DT_EGL, seems to have worked OK.
    
    next group by manufacturer?
    then calculate Eannul from UEF based on bin
